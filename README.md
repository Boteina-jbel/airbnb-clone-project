description: Property details.
location: Address or general area of the property.
price_per_night: Cost to book per night.
Relationships:
A property belongs to one user (Many-to-One).
A property can have many bookings (One-to-Many).
A property can have many reviews (One-to-Many).

3. Bookings
Description: Represents reservations made by users for specific properties.

id: Primary key.
user_id: Foreign key referencing Users (guest).
property_id: Foreign key referencing Properties.
check_in: Start date of the booking.
check_out: End date of the booking.
status: Booking status (e.g., confirmed, canceled).
Relationships:
Each booking is made by one user (Many-to-One).
Each booking is for one property (Many-to-One).
Each booking can have one associated payment (One-to-One).

4. Payments
Description: Records financial transactions related to bookings.
Key Fields:
id: Primary key.
booking_id: Foreign key referencing Bookings.
amount: Payment total.
payment_method: Method used (e.g., credit card, PayPal).
status: Payment status (e.g., paid, failed).
Relationships:
A payment is linked to one booking (One-to-One).

5. Reviews
Description: Feedback left by users about properties they have stayed in.
Key Fields:
id: Primary key.
user_id: Foreign key referencing Users.
property_id: Foreign key referencing Properties.
rating: Score (e.g., 1 to 5 stars).
comment: Textual feedback.
Relationships:
A review is written by one user (Many-to-One).
A review is for one property (Many-to-One).

Feature Breakdown:
1. User Management
Handles user registration, login, and profile management. It allows users to sign up as guests or hosts, authenticate securely, and manage their personal information.

2. Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature is crucial for maintaining a dynamic and accurate catalog of available rentals on the platform.

3. Booking System
Allows users to reserve available properties and manage their bookings. It supports check-in and check-out details and ensures properties are not double-booked.

4. Payment Processing
Facilitates secure and traceable transactions for property bookings. This feature supports various payment methods and records the payment status for each booking.

5. Review System
Permits users to leave ratings and reviews on properties after their stay. This feedback system helps maintain quality standards and guides future guests in making informed decisions.

6. API Endpoints
RESTful and GraphQL APIs are provided for interacting with users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews. This ensures developers can integrate or extend the platform easily.

7. Database Optimization
Uses indexing and caching mechanisms to enhance data retrieval performance and reduce load. This is vital for scaling the application to support high user traffic.

API Security:
1. Authentication
We will use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to verify user identity. This prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and ensures that only registered users can interact with protected endpoints.
Importance: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing personal profiles, making bookings, or managing property data.

2. Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to differentiate between hosts and guests. Only authorized users will be allowed to perform specific actions, such as listing properties or managing bookings.
Importance: Ensures users can only perform actions that match their role, protecting system integrity.

3. Rate Limiting
Implements throttling to limit the number of requests from a single IP or user in a given time frame. This protects the API from abuse and mitigates denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
Importance: Helps maintain system stability and defends against automated brute-force or spamming attempts.

4. Data Validation & Input Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Importance: Protects the database and users from malicious input that could compromise system behavior or data integrity.

5. HTTPS Enforcement
All API traffic will be served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
Importance: Secures sensitive information like login credentials and payment details from being intercepted over the network.

CI/CD Pipeline:

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. These pipelines help maintain code quality, detect bugs early, and ensure that new features are safely integrated into the main codebase without disrupting the system.
For the Airbnb Clone project, implementing CI/CD ensures rapid and reliable delivery of updates, allowing the team to maintain agility while avoiding manual deployment errors.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
GitHub Actions: Automates tasks such as running tests, linting, and deployment every time code is pushed to the repository.
Docker: Ensures the application runs consistently across different environments by containerizing the app and its dependencies.
Docker Hub: Stores and distributes container images automatically built from GitHub.
Heroku / Render / AWS / DigitalOcean (optional): Used for automated deployment of the backend service in staging or production.

âœ… Key Benefits:
Faster integration of new features with automated testing
Reduced risk of bugs and deployment errors
Continuous delivery of a production-ready backend
Improved collaboration through shared, reliable environments
